Hello, This is the 3rd version of my Music Training App, Yuki.

It features the ability to create timestamps on videos on youtube and write notes over them to remember what happened in that instance.

This can be useful when learning a song and having your notes be synced up to a youtube video.


My app right now is at a Proof of Concept phase, below are some ideas i will be implementing before the final release. 


There are various implementations that i will be adding in the coming months such as:

  - Database Storage
  - Social Media Integration 
  - Incentives to progress (achievements)
  - UI Overhauls.
